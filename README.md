# PointsCalculator
This was an extra-curricular project completed by myself and Steve Martin. 

We identified the opportunity to create a new application that could be used for the new Leaving Certificate Points system implemented in 2017. 

We used Java to complete this project and published the application to the Google Play Store.
We used Android Studio and Photoshop for this project.

The link to the application on the Google Play Store is as follows:
